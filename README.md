# Hey there 👋 I'm Chris!

I'm a London-based Frontend developer keen on crafting clean, functional products that address real customer needs. My approach thrives in collaborative environments that promotes pairing and snubs silos, fostering a dynamic exchange of ideas. With a mindset geared towards continuous learning, I embrace the ever-evolving nature of software development, always eager to explore new areas of interest.

My **latest role** was at: **[Qatalog](https://qatalog.com/)**, where I built features by writing [React](https://react.dev/) components using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) and testing my code with [RTL](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).
