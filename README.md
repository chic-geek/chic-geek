# Hey there 👋 I'm Chris!

I'm a London-based Frontend developer keen on crafting clean, functional products that address real customer needs. My approach thrives in collaborative environments that promotes pairing and snubs silos, fostering a dynamic exchange of ideas. With a mindset geared towards continuous learning, I embrace the ever-evolving nature of software development, always eager to explore new areas of interest.

My **latest role** was at: **[Nala](https://www.nala.money/)**, where I built various internal tools by writing [React](https://react.dev/) components using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) with [MUI](https://mui.com/) and [ShadCN UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) frameworks, all whilst testing my code using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).
